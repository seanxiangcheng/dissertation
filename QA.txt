Skype Meeting 9am Sunday, 6/26/2016, Chicago - Rio, Brazil
1. Haven't got time to write more details about the outline
2. Dissertation or paper first?

Introduction and vision? 
Big picture and literature;
one paragraph for one chapter;
Appendix for renormalization group;


write a good paper:
hyperbifurcation?
missing the physics part?
should look at susceptibility to see interesting physics?
y=0 HNNP X;
Hireachicy dependent order parameter?

magnitization and susceptiblity?
shinketin-patrick model
Kirpatric paper
